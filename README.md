## Weather Dashboard

Using the third party (free) weather API 'Open Weather Map', the application will display weather information based on a user's input of a major city.

The following will be available on this web application:

- Search bar for a major US city
- Current and future weather for the city entered
- Local storage will contain the user's city search history
- Icons are present based on the weather

I'm currently struggling with getting the icons to be visible and some of the dynamic formatting in js.
